# EU COVID-19 Challenge - Synthetic CT Data for Deep Learning
[EU COVID-19 Challenge](https://www.covid19challenge.eu/) organizers created a toy dataset from real Covid-19 CT data that is synthetic but quite realistic.

**Update Frequency:** One-time

**Dataset stats:** 96 CT volumes in NIFTI format with associated lung and infection masks.

**Dataset Profile:** [Medium Blog of Dr. Ahmadi](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-synthetic-ct-data-for-deep-learning-2dca1e43c4f0)
